Biolinux in a box (VM)

Since Bio-Linux (DistroWatch https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=biolinux) was discontinued in 2015 (v. 8.0.5), nobody has organized any other Linux distribution to replace it. I believe the distribution was discontinued because the Bioinfo data became so complex that we needed more powerful machines to do most of the analyses, good laptops became insufficient and CPUs gave way to GPUs. Even using a distribution focused on bioinformatics, considered one of the most complete, powerful, configurable and easy-to-use systems, not all users would be able to run more complete pipelines. For those like me who are still interested in using such a shared resource and learning by doing, I hope there is still hope. So we are starting something here!
