<b>Biolinux from scratch - Creating your own Bio-Linux Distro</b><br>
Since Bio-Linux (DistroWatch https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=biolinux) was discontinued in 2015 (latest version 8.0.5), nobody has organized any other Linux distribution to replace it. I believe the distribution was discontinued because the Bioinfo data became so complex that we needed more powerful machines to do most of the analyses, good laptops became insufficient and CPUs gave way to GPUs. Even using a distribution focused on bioinformatics, considered one of the most complete, powerful, configurable and easy-to-use systems, not all users would be able to run more complete pipelines. For those like me who are still interested in using such a shared resource and learning by doing, I hope there is still hope. Anyone interested to contribuite is welcome!

<b>Repository Goal</b><br>
Our main goal is to make different scripts available to help users install bioinformatics packages, discuss their usage by providing example data and actually analyze this data. Simply creating this repository will be a great opportunity for all of us to learn by doing, by programming Linux's own bash scripting language, by running the packages themselves, or by creating scripts to run them individually or in a pipeline!

<b>Installation</b><br>
Programming languages, package repositories and bioinformatics packages intended to be installed
